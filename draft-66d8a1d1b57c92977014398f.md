# Logging and Monitoring

**Cloudwatch** is a service in AWS that monitors your AWS resources and applications in realtime.

**Logging** refers to capturing or recording and storing detailed information about data events in log files. The data may include errors and warnings which give visibility on how your system performs under certain circumstances.

**Monitoring** tracks and reports system performance and the health of services through metrics and alarms.

**Metrics** refers to the quantitative measurement about a system or application performance. An example of a metric is CPU utilization that describes the amount of CPU utilized by an EC2 instance in the case of AWS.

**Alarm** is a monitoring feature in AWS Cloudwatch that allows automated actions to be taken based on specific conditions related to metrics.

**Amazon SNS Topic** is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel.It is simply a broadcast channel where you send a message and that message is automatically delivered to its subscribers.

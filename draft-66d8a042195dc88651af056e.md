## Introduction

In the digital landscape, organizations rely on a multitude of cloud resources like databases, compute instances, and storage solutions. As these infrastructures grow, controlling access becomes critical, which is where Identity and Access Management (IAM) plays a vital role.

**Identity and Access Management** **in AWS** ensures that only the right people access resources, with the right permissions.

Let’s take a scenario of Melbourne School that needs to move their on-premises traditional infrastructure to the cloud. The infrastructure consists of a web portal that allows students to purchase different swags such as AWS branded t-shirts and pens.It also consists of the Computer department gradebook which should only be accessible by professors.

This infrastructure is outdated and is very insecure where students can access the gradebook and change their grades and also hack the website to get ore swags than they purchased.

## **Shift Melbourne’s traditional Infrastructure to AWS Cloud.**

### **1\. Building a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

To host the web portal and gradebook system securely, deploy a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with two availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. This setup creates a logically isolated network on AWS. The configuration includ:

* **Public Subnet:** Used for the swag store’s web portal, making it accessible to students.
    
* **Private Subnet:** Dedicated to storing sensitive gradebook data, accessible only by the professor.
    
* **Two Availability Zones:** Resources will be spread across two availability zones, enhancing the system’s resilience by ensuring the portal remains accessible even if one zone experiences downtime.
    
* **Route Table and Internet Gateway:** Configured to route internet traffic to the public subnet, ensuring the portal remains accessible during high-traffic periods.
    

### **2\. Storing Data with Amazon S3**

Amazon S3 stores both the gradebook and the swag images. This service will provide secure storage while making it easier to retrieve data when needed.

* **Static Website Hosting:** Host a static website in an S3 bucket.Upload the portal’s content and enable public access through proper bucket permissions.
    
* **Data Security:** Restrict access to gradebook data IAM policies, ensuring that only the professor can retrieve or modify the data.
    

#### **3\. Securing Access with IAM**

The first priority is to lock down access to sensitive data. Employ IAM to manage and control user permissions, ensuring only authorized individuals, like the School Professor, can access or modify the gradebook.

* **Authentication and Authorization:** IAM authenticates users and authorize specific operations, preventing unauthorized access.
    
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** This principle gives users only the permissions they absolutely need.
    
* **IAM Policies:** Policies are written in JSON format, defining what actions are permitted for each user group. For example, the policy below denies student-user1 from accessing the S3 bucket containing gradebook data:
    

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"deny",
         "Principal":{
            "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::637423166894:user/student-user1"
         },
         "action":"s3*",
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::grdbk-data-fall-2023",
            "arn:aws:s3:::grdbk-data-fall-2023/*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

### **Challenges and Outcomes**

One of the main challenges is to ensure that the web portal remains accessible during high-traffic periods.Achieve this by leveraging the scalability of AWS.

Additionally, with proper IAM policies in place, unauthorized access to both the gradebook and the swag store will be fully locked down, eliminating the issues of students exploiting the system to alter grades or make unpaid purchases.

The bash prompt in linux shows information such as your username (who you are), your computer's name (hostname), and the directory you're currently working in.

A prompt can be customized to provide useful information to a user. This means that the prompt is different in various circumstances.

## The Primary Prompt String (PS1) variable

To alter a prompt description, we use the ***ps1 variable***. This variable controls how your command prompt looks in the terminal. It's like a template that defines the text you see each time the system is ready for you to type a command. It also enhances the prompt to give more information and visually attractive.

### Uses of the PS1 variable

* Display username, host-name and the current working directory.
    
* Add colors and special characters to the prompt.
    
* Show IP address
    
* Show data and time
    
* Show success or failure of a command especially in pen-tests.
    
* Show full path of the current working directory.
    

Prompt customization happens in the shell’s configuration file, ***.bashrc*** , specific for the bash shell.

### Customization characters

| **Character** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| \\d | Date (Mon Feb 6) |
| \\D{%Y-%m-%d} | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| \\H | Full hostname |
| \\j | Number of jobs managed by the shell |
| \\s | Name of the shell |
| \\t | Current time 24-hour (HH:MM:SS) |
| \\T | Current time 12-hour (HH:MM:SS) |
| \\u | Current username |
| \\w | Full path of the current working directory |

The prompt can look like the following examples:

```bash
<username>@<hostname><current working directory>$
```

```bash
<username>@<hostname>[~]$
```

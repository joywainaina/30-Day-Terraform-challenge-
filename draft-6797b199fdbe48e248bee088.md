Welcome to Day 1 of a continuous 90-day DevOps challenge. Over the next 90 days, I’ll be diving into the DevOps Culture, practices and tools, exploring automation, CI/CD, cloud computing, containerization, and more.

In this article, I will introduce DevOps by defining what the term means, explain various concepts in devops and end by stating the importance of devops in today’s applications and services.

# DevOps

DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools to improve a company’s application or services delivery at a high velocity.

The DevOps movement begun around [2007](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops/history-of-devops) where the development and IT operations communities raised concerns about the traditional software development model which built silos in the firms, where developers who wrote code worked apart from operations who deployed and supported the code.

The result was the birth of DevOps. It is a combination of the words *development* and *operations*, reflecting the process of integrating these disciplines into one, continuous process.

Other teams such as the security and Quality assurance team can adopt this culture. When a security team adopt the DevOps culture, the integration is called DevSecOps.

## What is automation, scaling and infrastructure.

***Automation*** is one of the backbones of DevOps. It’s the process of designing, developing and deploying applications and systems with minimal human intervention. The process of automation provides several benefits such as *speed and accuracy, consistency in routine tasks, reliability as they are less prone to human errors and increased productivity*. There are tools and practices designed for automation in the devops culture.

***Scaling*** is the ability of an infrastructure to handle an increased workload as the organization grows efficiently and effectively without negatively impacting performance or stability of a system. In a DevOps environment, scalability is achieved by use of cloud environments and containerization with tools such as docker and kubernetes. With a scalable system an organization can ensure high availability, improved response times and the ability to handle surges in traffic.

***Infrastructure*** in devops refers to the combination of tools, systems and process used to manage and automate IT resources such as servers and storage enabling faster and more reliable software delivery. Devops utilizes Infrastructure as code (which we will go through later in the upcoming articles) which simply means defining your infrastructure using code instead of manual processes.

## The importance of devops in today’s tech realm.

In the previous sections, we’ve defined devops, how it came to be and also explained some concepts in devops that we will come across. DevOps emerged as a practice because its culture provided significant benefits to developers. This section will explore the role of DevOps in modern architectures as technology continues to evolve.

1. **Improved quality and reliability** - DevOps enhances product quality by integrating testing throughout the development process rather than relegating it to the end stages. Continuous testing ensures that bugs are identified early when they are easier and less costly to fix.
    
2. **Enhanced collaboration and communication** - Combining the two teams increase the work culture significantly. Plus, they are happier, leading to increased productivity. Increased communication and trust allows more room for innovation and creativity. So, releasing the product will become their primary goal rather than their individual goals.
    
3. **Quicker development time** - Before devops, the development and operations teams worked separately while utilizing the SDLC lifecycle. The application needed to be fully developed for the operations team to build, test and deploy it. This took an increased amount of time. Devops bridges that gap where they now work closely than ever with automated processes for manually repetitive tasks.
    

## Conclusion

To wrap up, understanding why DevOps is Important helps you effectively strategize modern software Development. By encouraging collaboration, automating processes and ensuring continuous delivery, it gravitates teams towards faster innovation and responds to market demands with agility. In the upcoming days, we will dive deeper into the devops amazing world unveiling its magic. Stay tuned!

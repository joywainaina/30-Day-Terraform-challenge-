## **Securing data in Amazon S3**

![overview of S3 phase including buckets and how logs are queried](https://labs.vocareum.com/web/3355430/3853589.0/ASNLIB/public/docs/lang/en-us/images/phase1overview.png align="left")

### Create a bucket, apply a bucket policy, and test access

Create a bucket named data-bucket-0f5330a1056ef1e24 and accept all default settings.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740179361600/3ec968d5-8310-48a9-987b-253456aea219.png align="center")

Upload an object such as a file in the newly created bucket.

### Enable versioning and object-level logging on a bucket

Ensure that you are using the browser session where you’re logged in to the console as the *voclabs* IAM role.

Enable versioning on the *data-bucket*

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740183800727/a1ca6af1-1419-4349-810f-b0492184580e.png align="center")

Enable server access logging on the *data-bucket and* configure the logs to be written to the *s3-objects-access-log* bucket.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740183995182/03ffb4ff-1330-49f0-b88f-8d58fa3bc117.png align="center")

Verify that the bucket policy for the *s3-objects-access-log* bucket now includes a statement to allow the Amazon S3 logging service to write objects to the bucket.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740184167708/084d268c-e153-4769-b185-a5ba5afbab2d.png align="center")

### Implement the S3 Inventory feature on a bucket

Enable the S3 Inventory feature on the *data-bucket*.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740209191000/e0f0578b-5e97-4b99-b0d2-de6cbf83e79b.png align="center")

### Confirm that versioning works as intended

access the AWS account as the *paulo* user and upload an object to the *data-bucket*. Then, you are challenged to confirm that versioning is enabled on the object. You are also challenged to test access as the *mary* user. In the next task, you will analyze the object-level logs to see the actions that you took as different users in this task.

On your computer, create a new file named `customers.csv`. Then, copy the following text to the file and save the changes.

```plaintext
CustomerID,First Name,Last Name,Join Date,Street Address,City,State,Phone
1,Alejandro,Rosalez,12/12/2013,123 Main St.,Any Town,MD,301-555-0158
2,Jane,Doe,10/5/2014,456 State St.,Anywhere,WA,360-555-0163
```

Log in to the AWS account as the *paulo* user and upload the *customers.csv* file to the *data-bucket*.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740209877251/1b8d949a-30f7-4fe0-8b47-72e4c040f86e.png align="center")

Analyze how many versions of customer.csv exist by navigating to the *customers.csv* details page and choosing the **Versions** tab.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740210043517/bd0d5383-8d99-4e7e-a3d8-40f7966f62b7.png align="center")

On your computer, edit the *customers.csv* file and add more data to it. For example, add the following two rows of data at the bottom of the file.

In the browser window where you’re logged in as the *paulo* user, upload the new version of the *customers.csv* file to the *data-bucket*.

After you upload the file, notice the versions that are available.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740210281924/c2e65b8f-ad9e-456e-b594-dba3459cce9c.png align="center")

### Confirm object-level logging and query the access logs by using Athena

In the browser session where you're logged in to the console as the *voclabs* role, observe the objects that are stored in the *s3-objects-access-log* bucket. Download one of the objects, open it, and review the contents.

A separate object is created for every logged action, so the logs aren’t easy to read through

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740210795546/35539e16-8f86-4cd5-9da0-ae672e81c9be.png align="center")

you will see how to run queries against all the accumulated logs by using Amazon Athena queries.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740217859199/653c0d8e-3adc-4926-8714-4d881834ddf0.png align="center")

Create an Athena table from the access logs. To do this:

### Cost assessment to secure Amazon S3

## **Securing VPCs**

![Diagram showing pre-existing VPC resources used in task 2.1-2.5](https://labs.vocareum.com/web/3355430/3853589.0/ASNLIB/public/docs/lang/en-us/images/vpc-phase-diagram-1.png align="left")

### Review LabVPC and its associated resources

The subnet is not yet routed to the Internet Gateway.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740573077054/fd8a4cf5-3c10-4eed-ae87-8b2a981a09e2.png align="center")

In the IAM console, locate the *VPCFlowLogsRole* IAM role. Review the permissions that are granted to this role.

```plaintext
    {
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Action": [
				"logs:CreateLogGroup",
				"logs:CreateLogStream",
				"logs:Describe*",
				"logs:PutLogEvents"
			],
			"Resource": "*",
			"Effect": "Allow"
		}
	]
}
```

In the Amazon EC2 console, observe the details for the *WebServer* instance.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740574090986/0e3d032e-949d-4645-a68a-160138d556a3.png align="center")

### Create a VPC flow log

![Diagram showing VPC flow log architecture](https://labs.vocareum.com/web/3355430/3853589.0/ASNLIB/public/docs/lang/en-us/images/vpc_flow_logs.png align="left")

VPC Flow Logs feature can help you understand how inbound and outbound traffic flows through the VPC. The feature also provides monitoring information that will provide insights for how to secure the web server, subnets, and VPC in later tasks.

Create a VPC flow log for *LabVPC*

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740575205613/7aba49ec-cb3a-4e8c-8adb-35bea327c603.png align="center")

### Access the WebServer instance from the internet and review VPC flow logs in CloudWatch

The instance cannot be accessed because of a wrong network configuration of the security group.

Use the AWS Cloud9 **Cloud9Instance** IDE to test access to the *WebServer* instance using the netcat command.Test it with the HTTP port 80 and SSH port 22

```plaintext
nc -vz <Public IP> 80
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740576296892/7222a09a-63e6-4e4d-9f88-74a1f977faba.png align="center")

In the CloudWatch console, look at the log stream for the *LabVPCFlowLogs* log group to verify logs were generated by your actions in the previous step.

Notice that the *Message* field for all entries indicates "REJECT".

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740577029891/f6d67e2a-e368-42cd-82ef-58f64f962870.png align="center")

Filter the log entries to display only the events that originated from the public IP address of the AWS Cloud9 instance that you used to run commands earlier in the task.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740577086510/e977085b-453c-4dd4-b6cf-96c07c1fca95.png align="center")

### Configure route table and security group settings

![solution you implemented in security group to allow inbound SSH and HTTP traffic](https://labs.vocareum.com/web/3355430/3853589.0/ASNLIB/public/docs/lang/en-us/images/sg_igw.png align="left")

Modify the route table that is associated with the *WebServerSubnet*. Add a second route to the route table so that traffic to and from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) is routed to the existing *LabVPCIG* internet gateway.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740577729691/ad69ced3-cd15-4e81-b9df-b348b3e10e34.png align="center")

Test access from port 80 to the *WebServer* instance again. You can use the `nc` command in the AWS Cloud9 IDE or try to load the following address in a web browser: `http://<WebServer-public-IP>`

The connection times out or fails.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740577893527/242f6c2d-39ad-4024-9665-4a58af5dd3c1.png align="center")

Modify the inbound rules for the security group that is associated with the *WebServer* instance so that the instance's webpage will be accessible from the internet and so that certain SSH connections to it will be permitted. To do this:

Delete any inbound rules that already exist, unless they allow traffic to ports 22 or 80.

Add an inbound rule for HTTP traffic. The rule should allow traffic from *anywhere* to *TCP port 80*.

Add an inbound rule to allow SSH access to the *WebServer* instance from the AWS Cloud9 instance. Set the *source* for the rule to match the public IP address of the AWS Cloud9 instance. (You retrieved this IP address in an earlier task.)

**Important:** Append `/32` to the public IP address of the AWS Cloud9 instance. `/32` sets the CIDR range to exactly one IP address.

Add an inbound rule to allow SSH access to the *WebServer* instance so that you can use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to the instance.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740578870643/bb4306af-e918-461f-83e4-74f5004eb01b.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740578995899/8ce9db4f-3688-4c67-bc30-0863e53127f7.png align="center")

The instance can be accessed from the internet using a http port 80 connection.

Use EC2 Instance Connect to access the *WebServer* instance.

After you connect, run the following command: `ping -c 3` [`www.amazon.com`](http://www.amazon.com)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740579421699/3dfb535d-9a57-4a9b-96d7-80ad5af2044b.png align="center")

### Secure the WebServerSubnet with a network ACL

![diagram showing how the WebServerSubnet will be secured with custom network ACL rules.](https://labs.vocareum.com/web/3355430/3853589.0/ASNLIB/public/docs/lang/en-us/images/nacl.png align="left")

test whether you can access port 22 on the *WebServer* instance, modify the *100* rule from *Allow* to *Deny*. Then, run the `nc` command.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740579854312/0f4e56c8-19ab-48e9-8722-63b19ad5163c.png align="center")

Modify rule number 100 to *allow* connections on port 22 only. Then, use netcat to confirm whether you can access port 22.

The test should be successful.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740580015452/2011f50a-599f-421c-9b09-f2df74d52592.png align="center")

Edit the inbound rules for the network ACL again. Add a *new* rule that allows *HTTP* traffic from *anywhere*. Use *90* as the rule number.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740580232461/6ef7c078-fc3d-4e1e-a9e3-d1eef1641731.png align="center")

### Review NetworkFirewallVPC and its associated resources

An AWS network firewall enables you to create firewall rules that provide fine-grained control over network traffic and easily deploy firewall security across your VPCs.

Observe the existing NetworkFirewallVPC resources and configurations.

The network ACL settings for *NetworkFirewallVPC*.The default inbound rules exist. Rule 100 allows all traffic from all sources.

In *WebServer2* instance the inbound traffic is allowed from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) to ports 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH), and 8080.

Confirm access to the WebServer2 instance on ports 80 and 22.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740581252576/0a67b00b-425c-4800-bea7-3c1a784a927f.png align="center")

Start an additional website that runs on *WebServer2* port 8080 and test access.

* Use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to the *WebServer2* instance.
    

After you connect, run the following command.

```plaintext
python3 -m http.server 8080 &
```

Next steps

### Create a network firewall

In the Amazon VPC console, create a firewall named `NetworkFirewall`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740647810349/704f6cd0-d4b9-482e-9745-b97a277019bd.png align="center")

### Create route tables

In this task, you are challenged to create and configure three new route tables, including one for each subnet in the *NetworkFirewallVPC* and one to handle inbound (ingress) traffic for the internet gateway in *NetworkFirewallVPC*.

Create a new route table named `IGW-Ingress-Route-Table` in the *NetworkFirewallVPC*.

Edit the route table to add a new route.

Set the *destination* to be the CIDR block of the subnet that the *WebServer2* instance runs in.

Set the *target* to the only *Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint* that is available.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740649179202/e54db11d-64e7-427c-99c1-4e1bad7d8052.png align="center")

Add an edge association to the *IGW-Ingress-Route-Table* so that the *NetworkFirewallIG* internet gateway is associated with the route table.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740649619568/33f53fc4-991c-4fe6-a9da-3aa4b387458c.png align="center")

Create another route table in *NetworkFirewallVPC* for the *FirewallSubnet*.

* Name the route table `Firewall-Route-Table`
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740649683160/d68ff8cc-aeab-4256-b835-4bfd3329ec4f.png align="center")

* Add a route so that `0.0.0.0/0` traffic is routed to the *NetworkFirewallIG*.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740649808044/ffb195fe-53ce-491b-967c-269351d22476.png align="center")

Create an explicit association between the *FirewallSubnet* subnet and the route table.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740649899044/932a9676-303b-4d3a-a448-6126207f673e.png align="center")

Create another route table in *NetworkFirewallVPC* for the *Webserver2Subnet*.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740650005671/5879d66d-00b7-4a72-8bda-662b19402293.png align="center")

* Add a route so that `0.0.0.0/0` traffic is routed to the *Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint*.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740650582673/fff7c03e-4288-49a0-81cf-7cd7caba29a8.png align="center")

Create an explicit association between the *Webserver2Subnet* subnet and the route table.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740650689796/6966fed4-2333-4474-b79f-c1c5ba533166.png align="center")

### Configure logging for the network firewall

Create a CloudWatch log group named `NetworkFirewallVPCLogs` with a retention setting of *6 months*.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740662828930/8c0a8aba-d883-4c0f-8b9d-b726e5f55aa8.png align="center")

In the settings for the *NetworkFirewall* that you created, browse to the **Firewall details** area, and configure both **Alert** and **Flow** type logging. Set the log destination for both types of logging to use the *NetworkFirewallVPCLogs* CloudWatch log group.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740663386803/cdd1dbf2-e098-4946-9994-f331a13f3672.png align="center")

Test the logging configuration by attempting to load *WebServer2* instance's website on port 80 in a new browser tab.

The browser will time out when you attempt to access *WebServer2* at the public IPv4 address. This is expected because the network firewall policy isn’t yet configured to allow HTTP traffic on port 80. Recall that you could access the website at the start of task 2.6; however, you then created the network firewall in task 2.7.

### Configure the firewall policy and test access

By default, the empty policy blocks all traffic, which is why your attempt to load the *WebServer2* website in the previous task failed.

define and add a stateful rule group to the network firewall's policy. With this policy, traffic to and from the internet and the *NetworkFirewallVPC* will be monitored and managed. Access over specific ports will be allowed, and access over other ports will be specifically denied.

Navigate to the details page for the *NetworkFirewall* and begin to create the rule group.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740682118265/677ade5d-61ee-4496-99dc-12dc06a1fe2d.png align="center")

The results from the ping command confirm that access out to the internet is working and that responses are received over the ICMP protocol, which ping uses. The results of the netstat command show which TCP ports have running processes that are actively listening on them on the instance. For example, the *sshd* process is listening on port 22, and the *httpd* process is listening on port 80. You should also see that python3 is still listening on port 8080.
